# To-Do-Grocery-List
This program allows you to enter in a list of items you need to get at the grocery store. This program will list you what items you need to get. Once you complete your grocery shopping, you can take the items off your list. You can also leave the program at any point in the program. You can add a task to the to-do list, view the current to-do list, mark a task as completed, remove a task from the to-do list, remove all tasks from the to-do list, sort the list alphabetically, and count the # of items on the To-do List.
